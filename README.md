# Save The Theatre

<img src="/DocumentationScreen.png" alt="Save the Theater" />

Made by Ana Correia and Paulo Santos.

# Description
Save a Theater was a project made to put our newly acquired Vanilla JS, Bootstrap, flexbox
canvas, DOM manipulation (Document Object Model manipulation), and OOP 
(object-oriented programming) skills to the test. 
To achieve that my project partner and I developed a short vintage RPG style game



# Gameplay
## Prologue
A short intro to give the theatre's backstory.

## Dialogue
Your choices during the dialogue portion will affect which ending you will get.

## Rythm game
Press the keys as they appear on the screen to win. Howeever, you will be penalized if you take too long pressing a key.
